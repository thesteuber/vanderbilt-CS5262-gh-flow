Repository needed for assignment 2 of the Vanderbilt Machine Learning Summer 2022 course:

GH Flow Hands-On
One team member creates a repo (be sure to start with a Readme) and adds the second team
member to the repo.
1. Add the following two issues:
Issue #1 Add Team Member 1 to the Readme
In order to practice branching, making and closing out a pull request, issues, and
commits, please edit the Readme file in this repository. First. create a branch named
“Add [your name] to Readme”. Put your name in the second line of the readme. Commit
to this new branch. In your commit message include “Closes #1”.
Issue #2 Add Team Member 2 to the Readme
In order to practice branching, making and closing out a pull request, issues, and
commits, please edit the Readme file in this repository. First. create a branch named
“Add [your name] to Readme”. Put your name in the second line of the readme. Commit
to this new branch. In your commit message include “Closes #2”.
Team Member 1 takes Issue #1, and Team Member 2 takes Issue #2
2. Each person work their issue.
3. Look at the Issues. Is Issue #1 closed yet? Why not?
4. Both team members create a Pull Request. Team Member 1 shares screen, reviews
Team Member 2’s PR, merges, deletes branch, and closes the PR.
5. Pull up the Issues. Is Issue #1 closed now? Why now, and not before?
6. Team Member 2 shares screen, reviews Team Member 1’s PR, and UH OH! Conflict!!
Team Member 2 fixes it on GitHub using the editor. Merge, delete branch, and close the
PR.
What would be the effect of keeping the branches alive longer, and making more and more
changes before merging in?
